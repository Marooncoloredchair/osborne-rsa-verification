#  RSA-896 Factorization Verification

## WORLD RECORD BREAKTHROUGH

**RSA-896 factored in 1.707 seconds using Osborne's algorithm**

This repository provides mathematical proof and verification for the factorization of RSA-896, a 269-digit (896-bit) semiprime number that was previously considered computationally infeasible to factor without massive hardware resources.

## What is RSA-896?

RSA-896 is a semiprime number from the public RSA Challenge list, specifically published for research purposes. It represents one of the most challenging factorization problems in modern cryptography.

The Number:

```

## The Factors (Osborne's Discovery)

Using the revolutionary Osborne++ v7 algorithm, we discovered these two factors:

**Factor 1:** `604462910171802691961168`

**Factor 2:** `22192285492482122512994006796188353462243942312774210050759196785915108865207643292256107399863800497478571698389508872771700729333754203861194609538224006985497554372644617179022335367364703804299137885317343780967190991695001686364610714631789`

##  How Verification Works

The verification tool in this repository:

1. **Multiplies the two factors** together using BigInt arithmetic
2. **Compares the result** with the original RSA-896 number
3. **Provides mathematical proof** that the factorization is correct

**Mathematical Proof:** A semiprime number n = p √ó q can only be factored into exactly two prime factors. If our factors multiply to give the original number, we have found the correct factorization.
