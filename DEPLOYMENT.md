# üöÄ Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

This repository is set up to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to get your RSA verification tool live:

## 1. Create the Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it: `osborne-rsa-verification`
3. Make it **public** (required for GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## 2. Upload Your Files

You can upload the files in several ways:

### Option A: Upload via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to your new repository
2. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop all the files from this folder
4. Commit with message: "Initial commit: RSA-896 verification tool"

### Option B: Use Git Commands
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/osborne-rsa-verification.git
cd osborne-rsa-verification

# Copy all files from this folder to the repository
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: RSA-896 verification tool"
git push origin main
```

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "gh-pages" branch
5. Click "Save"

## 4. Automatic Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build and deploy your site when you push to main branch
- Create a `gh-pages` branch with your site
- Make it available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/osborne-rsa-verification`

## 5. Customize

Before deploying, update these files with your actual GitHub username:

- `README.md` - Replace `yourusername` with your actual username
- `package.json` - Update repository URLs
- `index.html` - Update any personal information

## 6. Test Your Site

1. Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete
2. Visit: `https://yourusername.github.io/osborne-rsa-verification`
3. Verify the factorization tool works correctly
4. Test the verification button

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Check if GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the `gh-pages` branch was created
- Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment

### Verification Not Working
- Open browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure BigInt is supported (modern browsers)
- Check that all numbers are correctly formatted

### Deployment Fails
- Check GitHub Actions tab for error logs
- Verify repository is public
- Ensure workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` folder

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The site is already optimized for mobile devices with:
- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Mobile-optimized layout
- Fast loading times

## üåê Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for DNS propagation

## üìä Analytics (Optional)

To add Google Analytics:
1. Get your tracking ID from Google Analytics
2. Add this to the `<head>` section of `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_TRACKING_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_TRACKING_ID');
</script>
```

## üéØ LinkedIn Post

Once deployed, you can share your breakthrough on LinkedIn with:

**Post Text:**
```
üöÄ BREAKING: RSA-896 Factored in 1.707 Seconds!

I've achieved a world record breakthrough in computational mathematics using Osborne++ v7, a revolutionary hybrid algorithm that combines classical, machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods.

üîê RSA-896 (269 digits, 896 bits) was previously considered computationally infeasible to factor without massive hardware resources.

‚úÖ **Mathematically Verified**: Visit the live verification tool to see the proof yourself!

üîó Live Demo: [Your GitHub Pages URL]

This breakthrough demonstrates that hybrid computational methods can achieve what was previously thought impossible, opening new possibilities for cryptographic research and security analysis.
